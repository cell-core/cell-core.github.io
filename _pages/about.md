# <a id="Home"></a> About Me
My name is Zhezhi Lei. I am currently persuing my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering at National University of Singapore (NUS), with an expected graduation in December 2024. During my master's studies, I am a member of Control & Simulation Lab, supervised by [Professor Shuzhi Sam Ge](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/ge-shuzhi-sam/), where I conducted research on motion planning with uncertainty in multi-agent systems. Before coming to NUS, I received my B.E. degree in Robotics Engineering from Harbin Engineering University, China.

Currently, I am working on an NUS student research project at Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SimTech) at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research ([A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/)), where I collaborate with [Dr. Haiyue Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uO_R9wQAAAAJ) on projects focusing on object detection in robot grasping.

My research instreset focus on robotics control, multi-agent and computer vision. 

# Recent Work 
(Update in September 2024)
- **In progress**: Object pose detection in robot grasping in the context of stacked workpieces (Supervised by Dr. Haiyue Zhu). Planned for submission to IROS.
- **Under review**: Safe motion planning for multi-vehicle autonomous driving in uncertain environments. Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL) on 15 August 2024 (Supervised by Prof. Shuzhi Sam Ge).
